## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections
**This is where you talk about your project!**

Struggling with making the tree root lines appear in the arrangement. Have been going a bit back and forth with scale. Think I have a good arrangement - now just need to fix roots. I will make another root to make the tree even on both sides and then add extras like grass and an axe potentially. 

The root lines are differing in size between editor and arrangement view - need to ammend.
