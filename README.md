I was fascinated by the idea of curating unique faces that we may not typically encounter in our daily lives. The randomness of nature and what appeared in an untouched setting like a forest intrigued me. The Chernoff Faces had particularly inspired me with their wacky depictions of faces. I challenged myself by moving away from my usual style of color blocking and vector shapes and instead used black and white outlines. My ultimate goal was to create a hand-drawn forest animation that portrayed wacky and startled tree stumps sitting in a forrest after just being chopped. The scene is set in an ariel view.
